# Calculator-App
This is a calculator application made with Java and JavaFX! The app's abilities are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

I made this project to expand on my coursework of JavaFX for CS400. Handling a graphic user interface and inputs was interesting but challenging.
